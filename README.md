### Wireframes

- The first wireframe in [Wadi](https://noah-samawi-myproject1-h-a8fyrwkkkp.us2.codeanyapp.com/#/workspaces/MyProject1-HTML-CSS) is a very simple design. It also shows an alternative option for the homepage layout which could be implemented in the future.

### Font and Colour choices

**Fonts:** "IBM Plex Sans "

**Colours:** Different colors will be chosen, but yellow, white, and black are still the main colors, because I think they are the colors that are most attractive to the customer.

## Features

This site implements the very basic features of a static website.

### Existing Features

- **Navigation Bar**

  - Featured in the header of all four pages. Includes links to Home page, About page, Events page and Contact form.
  - Uniform format allows for easy navigation on all pages without the use of the "back" button.

    ![navbar]()

- **Store image and Banner text**
  - The hero background image and text design is consistent throughout the site, while text content varies to match the page content.
  - The hero image had some opacity added in order to increase the contrast between the header text and the image.
