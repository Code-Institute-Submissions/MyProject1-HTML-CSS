## Bugs
During development the click to reveal function was tried to be implemented using only css. the chekbox method was tried to be used but the label for the checkbox needed to be a div ad that caused errors in the html validator. also the code was sometimes working for some boxes but not for all boxes, therefore javascript was used to implement that method. other small issues was faced during development but nothing important that can be mentioned within this bugs title.

### Unfixed bugs

No unfixed bugs to date.
