# Wadi

![responsive mock-up]()
Welcome to Wadi! The site is targeted at people who like to shop online. On this site, I will try to buy and sell online.

Visit live site [here](https://8000-noah-samawi-myproject1-h-a8fyrwkkkp.us2.codeanyapp.com/).

## Design

This site will be created during my study in Code institute.

### Wireframes

- The first wireframe in [Wadi](https://noah-samawi-myproject1-h-a8fyrwkkkp.us2.codeanyapp.com/#/workspaces/MyProject1-HTML-CSS) is a very simple design. It also shows an alternative option for the homepage layout which could be implemented in the future.

### Font and Colour choices

**Fonts:** "IBM Plex Sans "

**Colours:** Different colors will be chosen, but yellow, white, and black are still the main colors, because I think they are the colors that are most attractive to the customer.

## Features

This site implements the very basic features of a static website.

### Existing Features

- **Navigation Bar**
  - Featured in the header of all four pages. Includes links to Home page, About page, Events page and Contact form.
  - Uniform format allows for easy navigation on all pages without the use of the "back" button.

    ![navbar]()

- **Store image and Banner text**
  - The hero background image and text design is consistent throughout the site, while text content varies to match the page content.
  - The hero image had some opacity added in order to increase the contrast between the header text and the image.

### Site goals

The goal of this site is to provide LGBTQ+ teens and young adults of the wider Gort (Ireland) region with an easy to navigate club website. The site aims to present the necessary information in a simple, straight forward manner (including club rules, event schedule and details), as well as provide a way of contacting the club for potential new members.
